The GAP 4 package `SimplicialSurfaces'
==============================

To use this package, you first have to download or clone the repository
(cloning via git is preferable as you get updates more easily).

Then go into your installation directory for GAP, then the subfolder pkg/ and
put the SimplicialSurface-folder there. Afterwards you can use
        LoadPackage("SimplicialSurfaces")
to access the package inside GAP.


To create the manual you have to type
    make
in the main folder. This requires GAPDoc version >= 1.6 and AutoDoc version
>= 2017.09.08. If you don't have those, go to the folder of your local GAP 
installation and type
    cd pkg/
    git clone https://github.com/frankluebeck/GAPDoc.git
    git clone https://github.com/gap-packages/AutoDoc.git
To compile the pictures, you also need the following bash-commands:
    de-macro
    htlatex
    md5sum
    pdflatex
    sed
    

At the moment, the manual is still a work in process and definitely unfinished.
The current version of the manual can be found in the (unstable) branch 
"rewrite". To see it, use (in the main directory)
    git checkout rewrite
    make
Then the manual is doc/manual.pdf
To return to the stable branch, type
    git checkout master
