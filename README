The GAP 4 package `SimplicialSurfaces'
==============================

To use this package, you first have to download or clone the repository
(cloning via git is preferable as you get updates more easily).

Then go into your installation directory for GAP, then the subfolder pkg/ and
put the SimplicialSurface-folder there. Afterwards you can use
        LoadPackage("SimplicialSurfaces")
to access the package inside GAP.


To create the manual you have to type
    make
in the main folder. This requires GAPDoc version >= 1.6. If you don't have this
one, go to your local GAP installation and type
    cd pkg/
    git clone https://github.com/frankluebeck/GAPDoc.git

At the moment, the manual is still a work in process and definitely unfinished.


If there are any questions, don't hesitate to ask.
