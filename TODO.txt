Contraction: Delete two adjacent triangles
Enlargement: Add two adjacent triangles into a double-edge
    Automated testing by calculating the orbits of automorphism group on edges (not in same triangle, a vertex incident) -> into example?

Add standard names?


Colouring for drawing by circle around vertices.


Colour names: maybe call them DualColouring? -> They are proper edge colourings of the dual surface
