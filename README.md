The GAP 4 package `SimplicialSurfaces'
==============================


Since this package is not a complete GAP-package at this point in time, the
usage differs from usual packages.

1) Download or copy the repository (linking it to the online repository
    via git is preferable as you can get updates more easily)
2) Go into the folder gap/
3) Use "gap play.g" or read "play.g" from inside gap

The manual is in the folder doc/
At the current point in time it is more of a rough draft but it should be able
to explain the functionality of most methods you want to use in the immediate
future.

If there are any questions, don't hesitate to ask.

If you notice any bugs, strange behaviour or want to request a feature,
please use the "Issues"-Tab on GitHub. This makes sure that your contribution
will not get lost in some mails and it makes managing the requests easier.



Have fun! :)
