\title{Simplicial surfaces in GAP}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

In this talk I will present the SimplicialSurface--package for GAP (joint work 
with Alice Niemeyer), which allows us to work with polygonal complexes (a 
generalisation of simplicial surfaces) like these:
        \begin{center}
            \input{Image_ManyExamples.tex}
        \end{center} 

    They are represented by their incidence geometry (without a concrete
    embedding into some space).
    We can compute several properties of those
    complexes, some easy, e.\,g. orientability, and some
    harder, like isomorphism testing.

    Based on this general structure I will touch upon two of our research
    interests:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We consider special edge colourings with three colours, like
            this:
            \begin{center}
                %       F
                %    C     E 
                % A     B    D
                \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9]
                    \coordinate (A) at (0,0);
                    \coordinate (B) at (2,0);
                    \coordinate (C) at (1,1.4);
                    \coordinate (D) at ($2*(B)$);
                    \coordinate (E) at ($(B)+(C)$);
                    \coordinate (F) at ($2*(C)$);

                    \draw[blue, thick] (A) -- (B) -- (D);
                    \draw[blue, thick] (C) -- (E);
                    \draw[red, thick] (B) -- (C);
                    \draw[red, thick] (D) -- (E) -- (F);
                    \draw[black, thick] (A) -- (C) -- (F);
                    \draw[black, thick] (B) -- (E);
                \end{tikzpicture}
            \end{center}
            With these edge colourings we can capture the structure of
            the simplicial surface by a set of involutions in a symmetric
            group. Then we can use group--theoretical means to analyse the
            surfaces.
        \item We are interested in the folding of paper. Since working with
            embedded surfaces is very hard (even for small examples), we have
            generalised the concept of folding to polygonal complexes. For 
            example, we are interested in the possible structures that can
            be
            achieved by folding a polygonal complex.
    \end{itemize}
