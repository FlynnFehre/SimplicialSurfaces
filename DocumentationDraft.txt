Plan for the documentation of the package.

General goals:
1) Readability (it should not be very hard to read)
2) It should not be necessary to understand the structure of the manual to understand the concepts.
3) Navigation to related topics should be very easy and intuitive.
4) The manual should be strongly modular.
5) The manual should give good terminal support (if called with ??)

For concreteness we employ several test-users as benchmarks:
Technician: Wants to know how to apply an obscure function in full generality.
Worker: Wants to use an elementary method but forgot the exact procedure. Wants an answer shortly.
Searcher: Doesn't know the package, searches for a functionality and wants to know if the package can provide it.
Perfectionist: Wants to understand the package and its functionality completely.
Casual: Wants to get a general perspective but doesn't want to invest too much time.


First chapter:
Goal: Teaser for the package, show capabilities (S), pique interest (C), give framework (P)
Name: What can it do?
Content:
The SimplicialSurface-package contains this basic functionality:
1) Working with simplicial surfaces [Link to generic introduction] (and generalizations of that [Link to that]), for example:
    <Pictures of polygonal surfaces. Take care to have a diverse sample. Currently:
        - Tetrahedron (Triangle, closed, surface, oriented)
        - four triangles (Triangle, not closed, surface, oriented)
        - three triangles at one edge (Triangle, not closed, ramified)
        - Tetrahedron with triangle at one edge (Triangle, ramified)
        - Two pairs of triangles (connected by edge) that are connected by vertex (butterfly)
        - open cone (from two triangles) (Triangle, open, Anomalies)
        - a surface from non-triangle shapes (even mixed)

2) Treatment of folding and unfolding for these objects.

    TODO: make abstract nature clear


Second chapter
Goal: Teaser. Show actual examples with code. Keep people interested, don't ramp up the complexity too much.
[We will first do an example without knowing internal properties of the surface and only afterwards add this complexity]
Name: Playing with simplicial surfaces
Content:
Since the platonic solids are pre-defined [gives user some test-cases for experimenting] we use them to show the capabilities of this package.
    <Use cube (as it is known to more people than the other platonic solids and is quite small)>
    <Draw a picture and show the GAP-command Cube(), to avoid complicated constructors at the start>
We can compute elementary properties of the surface
    NrOfVertices
    NrOfEdges
    NrOfFaces
    EulerCharacteristic
and we can also show that the surface is homeomorphic to a sphere:
    IsClosedSurface
    IsConnected
    IsOrientable
    
We can also answer some more difficult questions like AutomorphismGroup or test for isomorphism (with one of the other platonic solids)
[TODO it is probably useful to show some capabilities. At the same time some users might be turned off if we linger too long on these
cases. We can do a list-style enumeration but this can run into the problem of being too long]


Third chapter
Goal: Motivate people to think about surfaces and constructors. Start easy (VerticesInFaces) and stay slow.
Name: Constructing some surfaces
Content:
Usually one is not interested in the properties of some platonic solids (usually you already know a lot about them).
Therefore we need a way to input our objects of interest into the package. 
As a test case we consider three triangles that all share one edge.
    <picture>
An easy way to describe this information is to label faces and vertices. In our case each triangle is determined by its three vertices.
For example, the face I consists of the vertices [1,2,3] and the face III has the vertices [1,2,5]. From this information we can construct the simplicial complex:
    SimplicialSurfaceByVerticesInFaces( [[1,2,3],[1,2,4],[1,2,5]] );
