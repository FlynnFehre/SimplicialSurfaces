#!
#!	@Chapter Simplicial Surfaces
#!
#! A SimplicialSurface-object in GAP represents mathematical objects that are
#! a generalization of simplicial surfaces. On the most basic level it
#! consists of vertices, edges and faces, together with an incidence relation
#! between them. This information is saved in the following form:
#! * the vertices are represented by a set of positive integers
#! * the edges are represented by a set of positive integers
#! * the faces are represented by a set of positive integers
#! * the incidence relation between vertices and edges (that is, which
#!   vertices lie in which edges) is represented by a list VerticesOfEdges.
#!   For each edge e the entry VerticesOfEdges[e] is a set of all vertices
#!   that are incident to the edge e.
#! * the incidence relation between edges and faces (that is, which
#!   edges lie in which faces) is represented by a list EdgesOfFaces. For
#!   each face f the entry EdgesOfFaces[f] is a set of all edges that are
#!   incident to the face f.
#!
#! Every other incidence (like VerticesOfFaces or EdgesOfVertices) is 
#! represented in an analogous fashion.
#!
#! Furthermore we impose some restrictions onto these incidence relations:
#! * Every edge is incident to exactly two vertices
#! * Every face is incident to the same number of vertices and edges (at least
#!   three). Additionally these are cyclically oriented (to represent an 
#!   n-gon)
#! * The incidence relations are transitive
#! * Every vertex and every edge is incident to at least one face
#!
#! Note that it is allowed for an edge to be incident to more than two faces.
#!
#!  
#! In addition it is sometimes necessary to distinguish between the two
#! sides of a single face. If this is irrelevant to your application, you
#! can completely ignore this (it will be handled in the background).
#! To use this distinction each side of a face f gets a name - the defaults
#! are +f and -f (but you can give them custom names if you want to). To 
#! distinguish which side is which (not only by a name, but geometrically)
#! we save a cyclic ordering of the vertices (or edges) of each face which
#! we associate with the side +f. (In an embedding to $\mathbb{R}^3$ we could
#! associate the cyclic ordering with the normal vector of the face that is
#! defined by the right-hand-rule from physics.)


DeclareInfoClass( "InfoSimplicial" );
SetInfoLevel(InfoSimplicial,1);
# TODO explain structure of everything in a separate tex-file

#TODO remove LocalOrientation from simplicial surfaces (separate incidence 
# geometry and orientation). Then add CyclicVertexOrderAsPerm or something
# like that. Does this work in the bigger context??

##
##	Categories are used to determine which methods are applicable for a
##	certain object. The category for simplicial surfaces should be able to
##	save attributes once they are computed (this includes properties) and
##	consists of components.
##
DeclareCategory( "IsSimplicialSurface",
			IsComponentObjectRep and IsAttributeStoringRep );

##
##	Define a new family for simplicial surfaces. The family defines a necessary
##	condition that has to be fulfilled for objects to be equal to each other.
##	The argument IsSimplicialSurface guarantees that only objects that lie in
##	this category can be part of the family.

#!  @Section Advanced properties of simplicial surfaces
#!
#!
#! Since the SimplicialSurface-objects in GAP can represent more general
#! structures than just surfaces there is a property that checks whether a
#! generic SimplicialSurface-objects represents an actual surface (the property
#! IsActualSurface).
#!
#! To check whether a generic SimplicialSurface-object represents an actual
#! surface we have to check the edges and the vertices.
#! * In an actual surface every edge is incident to at most two faces. This
#!   property is checked by IsEdgesLikeSurface.
#! * If each edge is incident to at most two faces, we can define
#!   face-edge-paths around each vertex. A face-edge-path around a vertex $v$
#!   is a list $(e_1,f_1,e_2,f_2,\dots,e_n,f_n)$ or 
#!   $(e_1,f_1,e_2,f_2,\dots,e_n,f_n,e_{n+1})$ such that
#!   - all $e_i$ are pairwise distinct edges incident to the vertex $v$
#!   - all $f_i$ are pairwise distinct faces incident to the vertex $v$
#!   - if two elements are adjacent in a face-edge-path, they are incident in
#!     the simplicial surface
#!   - if the face-edge-path has even length (the first case), we require that
#!     $e_1$ and $f_n$ are incident (this represents a closed path)
#!   - if the face-edge-path has odd length (the second case), we require that
#!     both $e_1$ and $e_{n+1}$ are only incident to one face (this represents
#!     an open path)
#!
#TODO why does this list structure not work? Can be fixed by using HTML-lists
# Start with <List>, end with </List> and use <Item> and </Item> to delineate the items
#!   In general there may be many of those paths around a vertex (they 
#!   partition the edges and faces incident to each vertex) but in an actual
#!   surface there is only one such path. The property IsVerticesLikeSurface
#!   checks this property.
#!

#! @Description
#! Under the assumption that every edge is incident to at most two faces (which
#! allows the definition of face-edge-paths) the property IsVerticesLikeSurface
#! holds if there is only one face-edge-path (up to description) around each
#! vertex.
#! @Arguments simpSurf
DeclareProperty( "IsVerticesLikeSurface", IsSimplicialSurface );

#! @Description
#! The property IsEdgesLikeSurface holds if every edge of the simplicial

#!  @Section Local and global orientations
#!
#! If we consider an embedding of a simplicial surface, each face gets mapped
#! onto a polygon (usually a triangle). For each such polygon there are exactly
#! two normal vectors that define the two "sides" of the polygon. Via the
#! right-hand-rule from physics we can identify each normal vector with a
#! cyclic permutation of the vertices in the polygon. For example, if a given
#! face is incident to the vertices $\{1,2,3\}$, then the possible cyclic
#! permutations are (1,2,3) and (1,3,2). If the polygon has more than three
#! vertices then adjacent vertices in these permutations have to be connected
#! by an edge.
#! <P/>
#! The same construction can be used to derive a cyclic permutation of the
#! incident edges. In addition it is sometimes useful to encode these
#! permutations as lists, for example the permutation (1,2,3) corresponds to
#! the list [1,2,3] (the first entry has to be the smallest one to make this
#! choice of list unique).
#! <P/>
#! A **local orientation** of a given face can now be described in four
#! equivalent ways:
#! * ByVerticesAsPerm
#!   <P/>
#!   This is a cyclic permutation p of all vertices incident to the face such
#!   that v and p(v) are incident to an edge of the face (for each vertex v
#!   in the face).
#! * ByVerticesAsList
#!   <P/>
#!   This is a list of all vertices indicent to the face that encodes the
#!   permutation of **ByVerticesAsPerm**. The first entry is the smallest
#!   vertex among those incident to the face.
#! * ByEdgesAsPerm
#!   <P/>
#!   This is a cyclic permutation p of all edges incident to the face such
#!   that e and p(e) are incident to an edge of the face (for each edge e
#!   in the face).
#! * ByEdgesAsList
#!   <P/>
#!   This is a list of all edges indicent to the face that encodes the
#!   permutation of **ByEdgesAsPerm**. The first entry is the smallest
#!   edge among those incident to the face.
#! 
#! A standard local orientation is used to distinguish the different sides for
#! each face. There is no necessary connection between local orientations of
#! different faces. It is possible to give the sides different names. If
#! no special measures are taken, the side that is distinguished by the standard
#! local orientation is known as f, whereas the other side is known as -f.
#! <P/>
#! <P/>
#! If the simplicial surface is orientable (which is only well-defined if the 
#! property IsEdgesLikeSurface is true), we can assign a global orientation.
#! More specifically there are $2^c$ different global orientations, where $c$
#! denotes the number of path-connected components of the simplicial surface
#! (two faces are path-connected if there exists a face-edge-path between them
#! that is not necessarily incident to only one vertex).
#! <P/>
#! To return a unique global orientation we pick the smallest face in each
#! path-connected component and assign the standard local orientation to
#! this face.
#! <P/>
#! To describe the distinguished global orientation we have the same options
#! as in the local case.

#!  @Section Technical functions (for development)
#!
#! This section contains methods that concern the internal structure of
#! simplicial surfaces. You only have to read this section if you want to
#! understand the underlying implementation better or if you want to develop
#! code that is derived from this.
#!
#! There are three unique features in the implementation of simplicial surfaces
#! that especially concern the definition of specializes simplicial surfaces:
#! - The use of a method selection graph
#! - A general methods to help defining specialized classes
#! - A guide for easier initialization
#!
#! Since the method selection graph is the most salient feature we will cover
#! it first. It derives from a simple observation: If you know either
#! VerticesOfEdges or EdgesOfVertices, you can calculate the other. If you 
#! additionally know either of EdgesOfFaces or FacesOfEdges, you can calculate
#! all six of these attributes. This could have been implemented by a lot of
#! specialized methods but the number of these methods rised exponentially
#! with the number of attributes that are connected.
#!
#! Instead we only implement methods for the ``difficult'' parts (where work
#! has to be done) and delegate the ``easy'' parts (if we can calculate B from
#! A and C from B, we can also calculate C from A) into a method selection
#! graph. If an attribute should be part of the method selection graph (which
#! it only should if you can calculate information inside the method selection
#! graph from this attribute) you have to make two modifications:
#! - There has to be a method to calculate this attribute by the method
#!   selection graph, like
#! @BeginCode TODO Including code does not work if it is read normally
#! InstallMethod( VerticesOfFaces, "for a simplicial surface", 
#!    [ IsSimplicialSurface ],
#!    function( surf )
#!        return ComputeProperty(SIMPLICIAL_METHOD_SELECTION_GRAPH, 
#!                VerticesOfFaces, surf);
#!    end
#! );
#! @EndCode
#! - For each ``difficult'' method there has to be a call that adds this 
#!   possibility into the method selection graph, like
#! @BeginCode
#! AddPropertyIncidence( SIMPLICIAL_METHOD_SELECTION_GRAPH, 
#!	"VerticesOfFaces", ["EdgesOfFaces", "VerticesOfEdges"] );
#! @EndCode
#!
#! 
#! Secondly we guarantee unique methods for specialization. To consider a 
#! specific example, imagine we want to give certain simplicial surfaces an
#! edge colouring. If one simplicial surface may have different edge colourings
#! we can't implement this as an attribute of the simplicial surface. Instead
#! we define a new type for this situation (as a subtype of 
#! SimplicialSurfaceType).
#!
#! The disadvantage of this procedure is that is becomes harder to take a
#! simplicial surface as input and add an edge colouring (type changes are
#! frowned upon in GAP). For this reason we offer a special method that does
#! just that - it copies many attributes of the simplicial surface into an
#! object of the new type.

#! @Description
#! This function calls
#! @BeginCode
#! Objectify( type, rec )
#! @EndCode
#! and afterwards copies all attributes and properties of the simplicial
#! surface modelSurf that are declared in this section to the the new object.
#!	
#! This method has to be overwritten for a specialization of this class.
#!
#! WARNING: The type can't be checked! Only types that are derived from
#! IsSimplicialSurface can be used with impunity!
#!
#! @Arguments type, record, simpSurf
#! @Returns an object of type type
DeclareOperation( "ObjectifySimplicialSurface",
		[IsType,IsRecord,IsSimplicialSurface]);



#! Finally we consider the constructors. Simplicial surfaces are defined by
#! an incidence structure **and** a local orientation (with face names).
#! However, only the incidence structure has to be given - the local
#! orientation can be derived (in the sense that there are several possibilites
#! and one of them will be picked). To facilitate this procedure we offer a
#! method which can be called **after** the incidence structure is defined.

#! @BeginGroup
#! @Description
#! This is a method which should only be used in code development. It should
#! not be called by a normal user as it presupposes knowledge of the internal
#! attribute storing system.
#!
#! A simplicial surface consists of two separate sets of attributes: One set
#! of attributes to save the incidence geometry (Vertices, Edges, Faces,
#! EdgesOfFaces, etc.), the other to save the local orientation of the faces
#! (LocalOrientationOfVerticesAsPerm, NamesOfFaces, etc.). While the second
#! set of attributes may be crucial for some applications (like folding), it
#! is easy to ignore it in other applications.
#! 
#! This is usually managed by a judicious constructor call that will handle
#! the necessary overhead without burdening the user. If - for whatever 
#! reason - no constructor should be called (for example for a subcategory
#! of IsSimplicialSurface) this method can be used to initialize all necessary
#! attributes of the second set.
#! 
#! This method will throw an error if some of these attributes are already set.
#! It will only check the attributes
#! - LocalOrientationByVerticesAsPerm
#! - LocalOrientationByVerticesAsList
#! - LocalOrientationByEdgesAsPerm
#! - LocalOrientationByEdgesAsList
#! - IsFaceNamesDefault
#! - NamesOfFaces
#! If other attributes interfere with these, they will not be checked! For
#! this reason this method should only be called if one knows exactly which
#! attributes are already set.
#!
#! The NC-version doesn't check whether attributes are set (it is therefore
#! even more dangerous to use).
#!
#! @Arguments simpSurf
#! @Returns nothing
DeclareOperation( "DeriveLocalOrientationAndFaceNamesFromIncidenceGeometry",
	[IsSimplicialSurface] );
DeclareOperation( "DeriveLocalOrientationAndFaceNamesFromIncidenceGeometryNC",
	[IsSimplicialSurface] );
#! @EndGroup
