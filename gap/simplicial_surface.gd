##
##  This file contains the declaration part for the simplicial surfaces
##	of the SimplicialSurfaces package.
##
##	A SimplicialSurface consists of vertices, edges and faces. Each of those
##	is enumerated by positive integers (not necessarily consecutively).
##	Furthermore we have an incidence relation between them.
##
##	We additionally require a local orientation for each face - that is we
##	want to distinguish its two sides. Therefore we also need names for both
##	sides. The default naming scheme (which will be applied if the user does
##	not explicitly objects) is that the two sides of the face f will be called
##	+f and -f. With this scheme all positive integers represent the "upper
##	sides" and negative integers the "lower sides". A side effect is that the
##	name of a face and of its upper side coincide. It is usually clear from
##	context which one is meant.
##
##	Sometimes we may impose an additional structure on this surface, by
##	partitioning the set of edges into three subsets such that each face (which
##	we assume to be triangular) is bordered by all three subsets. This allows
##	us to define an involution for each subset. These three involutions are
##	in many cases sufficient to reproduce to original surface.
##

DeclareInfoClass( "InfoSimplicial" );
SetInfoLevel(InfoSimplicial,1);


##
##	Categories are used to determine which methods are applicable for a
##	certain object. The category for simplicial surfaces should be able to
##	save attributes once they are computed (this includes properties) and
##	consists of components.
##
DeclareCategory( "IsSimplicialSurface",
			IsComponentObjectRep and IsAttributeStoringRep );

##
##	Define a new family for simplicial surfaces. The family defines a necessary
##	condition that has to be fulfilled for objects to be equal to each other.
##	The argument IsSimplicialSurface guarantees that only objects that lie in
##	this category can be part of the family.

    NewFamily("SimplicialSurfaceFamily",  IsObject, IsSimplicialSurface);

##	The set of faces (alternatively a number n that becomes [1..n] )
