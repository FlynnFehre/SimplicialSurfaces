#!	@Chapter Simplicial Surfaces
#!
#! A SimplicialSurface-object in GAP represents mathematical objects that are
#! a generalization of simplicial surfaces. On the most basic level it
#! consists of vertices, edges and faces, together with an incidence relation
#! between them. This information is saved in the following form:
#! * the vertices are represented by a set of positive integers
#! * the edges are represented by a set of positive integers
#! * the faces are represented by a set of positive integers
#! * the incidence relation between vertices and edges (that is, which
#!   vertices lie in which edges) is represented by a list VerticesOfEdges.
#!   For each edge e the entry VerticesOfEdges[e] is a set of all vertices
#!   that are incident to the edge e.
#! * the incidence relation between edges and faces (that is, which
#!   edges lie in which faces) is represented by a list EdgesOfFaces. For
#!   each face f the entry EdgesOfFaces[f] is a set of all edges that are
#!   incident to the face f.
#!
#! Every other incidence (like VerticesOfFaces or EdgesOfVertices) is 
#! represented in an analogous fashion.
#!
#! Furthermore we impose some restrictions onto these incidence relations:
#! * Every edge is incident to exactly two vertices
#! * Every face is incident to the same number of vertices and edges (at least
#!   three). Additionally these are cyclically oriented (to represent an 
#!   n-gon)
#! * The incidence relations are transitive
#! * Every vertex and every edge is incident to at least one face
#!
#! Note that it is allowed for an edge to be incident to more than two faces.
#!
#!  
#! In addition it is sometimes necessary to distinguish between the two
#! sides of a single face. If this is irrelevant to your application, you
#! can completely ignore this (it will be handled in the background).
#! To use this distinction each side of a face f gets a name - the defaults
#! are +f and -f (but you can give them custom names if you want to). To 
#! distinguish which side is which (not only by a name, but geometrically)
#! we save a cyclic ordering of the vertices (or edges) of each face which
#! we associate with the side +f. (In an embedding to $\mathbb{R}^3$ we could
#! associate the cyclic ordering with the normal vector of the face that is
#! defined by the right-hand-rule from physics.)

#!  @Section Advanced properties of simplicial surfaces
#!
#!
#! Since the SimplicialSurface-objects in GAP can represent more general
#! structures than just surfaces there is a property that checks whether a
#! generic SimplicialSurface-objects represents an actual surface (the property
#! IsActualSurface).
#!
#! To check whether a generic SimplicialSurface-object represents an actual
#! surface we have to check the edges and the vertices.
#! * In an actual surface every edge is incident to at most two faces. This
#!   property is checked by IsEdgesLikeSurface.
#! * If each edge is incident to at most two faces, we can define
#!   face-edge-paths around each vertex. A face-edge-path around a vertex $v$
#!   is a list $(e_1,f_1,e_2,f_2,\dots,e_n,f_n)$ or 
#!   $(e_1,f_1,e_2,f_2,\dots,e_n,f_n,e_{n+1})$ such that
#!   - all $e_i$ are pairwise distinct edges incident to the vertex $v$
#!   - all $f_i$ are pairwise distinct faces incident to the vertex $v$
#!   - if two elements are adjacent in a face-edge-path, they are incident in
#!     the simplicial surface
#!   - if the face-edge-path has even length (the first case), we require that
#!     $e_1$ and $f_n$ are incident (this represents a closed path)
#!   - if the face-edge-path has odd length (the second case), we require that
#!     both $e_1$ and $e_{n+1}$ are only incident to one face (this represents
#!     an open path)
#!
#TODO why does this list structure not work? Can be fixed by using HTML-lists
# Start with <List>, end with </List> and use <Item> and </Item> to delineate the items
#!   In general there may be many of those paths around a vertex (they 
#!   partition the edges and faces incident to each vertex) but in an actual
#!   surface there is only one such path. The property IsVerticesLikeSurface
#!   checks this property.
#!

#! @Description
#! Under the assumption that every edge is incident to at most two faces (which
#! allows the definition of face-edge-paths) the property IsVerticesLikeSurface
#! holds if there is only one face-edge-path (up to description) around each
#! vertex.

#!  @Section Local and global orientations
#!
#! If we consider an embedding of a simplicial surface, each face gets mapped
#! onto a polygon (usually a triangle). For each such polygon there are exactly
#! two normal vectors that define the two "sides" of the polygon. Via the
#! right-hand-rule from physics we can identify each normal vector with a
#! cyclic permutation of the vertices in the polygon. For example, if a given
#! face is incident to the vertices $\{1,2,3\}$, then the possible cyclic
#! permutations are (1,2,3) and (1,3,2). If the polygon has more than three
#! vertices then adjacent vertices in these permutations have to be connected
#! by an edge.
#! <P/>
#! The same construction can be used to derive a cyclic permutation of the
#! incident edges. In addition it is sometimes useful to encode these
#! permutations as lists, for example the permutation (1,2,3) corresponds to
#! the list [1,2,3] (the first entry has to be the smallest one to make this
#! choice of list unique).
#! <P/>
#! A **local orientation** of a given face can now be described in four
#! equivalent ways:
#! * ByVerticesAsPerm
#!   <P/>
#!   This is a cyclic permutation p of all vertices incident to the face such
#!   that v and p(v) are incident to an edge of the face (for each vertex v
#!   in the face).
#! * ByVerticesAsList
#!   <P/>
#!   This is a list of all vertices indicent to the face that encodes the
#!   permutation of **ByVerticesAsPerm**. The first entry is the smallest
#!   vertex among those incident to the face.
#! * ByEdgesAsPerm
#!   <P/>
#!   This is a cyclic permutation p of all edges incident to the face such
#!   that e and p(e) are incident to an edge of the face (for each edge e
#!   in the face).
#! * ByEdgesAsList
#!   <P/>
#!   This is a list of all edges indicent to the face that encodes the
#!   permutation of **ByEdgesAsPerm**. The first entry is the smallest
#!   edge among those incident to the face.
#! 
#! A standard local orientation is used to distinguish the different sides for
#! each face. There is no necessary connection between local orientations of
#! different faces. It is possible to give the sides different names. If
#! no special measures are taken, the side that is distinguished by the standard
#! local orientation is known as f, whereas the other side is known as -f.
#! <P/>
#! <P/>
#! If the simplicial surface is orientable (which is only well-defined if the 
#! property IsEdgesLikeSurface is true), we can assign a global orientation.
#! More specifically there are $2^c$ different global orientations, where $c$
#! denotes the number of path-connected components of the simplicial surface
#! (two faces are path-connected if there exists a face-edge-path between them
#! that is not necessarily incident to only one vertex).
#TODO write methods for path-connected components
#! <P/>
#! To return a unique global orientation we pick the smallest face in each
#! path-connected component and assign the standard local orientation to
#! this face.
#! <P/>
#! To describe the distinguished global orientation we have the same options
#! as in the local case.
#!

#! @Description
#! If we have a simplicial surface where every edge is incident to at most two
#! faces, this method checks if the surface is orientable. (A simplicial surface
#! is orientable if we can assign a side for each face such that for every two
#! adjacent sides either both or none are assigned.
#! @Arguments simpSurf
DeclareProperty( "IsOrientable", IsSimplicialSurface and IsEdgesLikeSurface );


#! @Description
#! Return the distinguished global orientation if the simplicial surface is 
#! orientable. Warning: The returned orientation depends on the chosen local
#! orientation of the simplicial surface. This might not be equal even if the
#! incidence structure is.
#! <P/>
#! The orientation is returned as a list globalOr. For each face f the entry
#! globalOr[f] contains a list of the vertices that are incident in the face f.
#! The order of this list corresponds to the orientation of the face f with
#! respect to the global orientability.
#! <P/>
#! This method returns fail if the given surface is not orientable.

##
#!	@Description
#!	This function calls
#!		Objectify( type, rec )
#!	and afterwards copies all attributes and properties of the simplicial
#!	surface modelSurf that are declared in this section to the the new object.
#!	This method has to be overwritten for a specialization of this class.
#!
#!	WARNING: The type can't be checked! Only types that are derived from
#!	IsSimplicialSurface can be used with impunity!
#!
#!	@Arguments a type, a record, a simplicial surface
#!	@Returns an object of type type
DeclareOperation( "ObjectifySimplicialSurface",
		[IsType,IsRecord,IsSimplicialSurface]);


##
#!	@Description
#!	This is a method which should only be used in code development. It should
#!	not be called by a normal user as it presupposes knowledge of the internal
#!	attribute storing system.
#!
#!	A simplicial surface consists of two separate sets of attributes: One set
#!	of attributes to save the incidence geometry (Vertices, Edges, Faces,
#!	EdgesOfFaces, etc.), the other to save the local orientation of the faces
#!	(LocalOrientationOfVerticesAsPerm, NamesOfFaces, etc.). While the second
#!	set of attributes may be crucial for some applications (like folding), it
#!	is easy to ignore it in other applications.
#!	This is usually managed by a judicious constructor call that will handle
#!	the necessary overhead without burdening the user. If - for whatever 
#!	reason - no constructor should be called (for example for a subcategory
#!	of IsSimplicialSurface) this method can be used to initialize all necessary
#!	attributes of the second set.
#! 
#!	This method will throw an error if some of these attributes are already set.
#!	It will only check the attributes
#!		- LocalOrientationByVerticesAsPerm
#!		- LocalOrientationByVerticesAsList
#!		- LocalOrientationByEdgesAsPerm
#!		- LocalOrientationByEdgesAsList
#!		- IsFaceNamesDefault
#!		- NamesOfFaces
#!	If other attributes interfere with these, they will not be checked! For
#!	this reason this method should only be called if one knows exactly which
#!	attributes are already set.
#!
#!	The NC-version doesn't check whether attributes are set (it is therefore
#!	even more dangerous to use).
#!
#!	@Arguments a simplicial surface
#!	@Returns nothing
DeclareOperation( "DeriveLocalOrientationAndFacesNamesFromIncidenceGeometry",
	[IsSimplicialSurface] );
DeclareOperation( "DeriveLocalOrientationAndFacesNamesFromIncidenceGeometryNC",
	[IsSimplicialSurface] );

##
#!	@Description
#!	This function returns both names of the given face. The first entry is
#!	the name of the upper side, the second one of the lower side.
#!	The NC-version doesn't check if the given number actually is a face.
#!	@Arguments a simplicial surface object simpsurf, a face number
#!	@Returns a list with two elements
#!
DeclareOperation( "NamesOfFace", [IsSimplicialSurface, IsPosInt] );

#!	@Description
#!	Return the face-number of the simplicial surface that has the given name
#!	as the name of one of its sides.
#!	@Arguments a simplicial surface object simpsurf, an integer
#!	@Returns a positive integer

##
#!	@Description
#!	This function returns the simplicial subsurface that is defined by the
#!	given set of faces.
#!	The NC-version does not check if the given faces actually are faces of
#!	the simplicial surface.
#!	@Arguments a simplicial surface object simpsurf, a set of positive integers
#!	@Returns a simplicial surface object
#!
DeclareOperation( "SubsurfaceByFaces", [IsSimplicialSurface, IsSet] );

#!	the resulting surface.
#!	@Arguments a simplicial surface object simpsurf
#!	@Returns a simplicial surface object
#!
DeclareOperation( "SnippOffEars", [IsSimplicialSurface] );

##
#!	@Description
#!	This function removes all ears of the simplicial surface. If the resulting
#!	surface still has ears, it removes them as well (and so on). The final
#!	surface is returned..
#!	@Arguments a simplicial surface object simpsurf
#!	@Returns a simplicial surface object
#!
DeclareOperation( "SnippOffEarsRecursive", [IsSimplicialSurface] );

##
#!	@Description
#!	This function returns the connected component of the given face.
#!	The NC-version doesn't check if the given face actually is one.
#!	@Arguments a simplicial surface object simpsurf, a positive integer
#!	@Returns a simplicial surface object
#!

DeclareOperation( "ConnectedComponentOfFaceNC", [IsSimplicialSurface, IsPosInt] );

##
#!  @Description
#!  Check if two simplicial surfaces are isomorphic. This method only checks
#!	if they are isomorphic with respect to the incidence relation. It does
#!	not check if additional structure like a wild coloring is isomorphic (or
#!	even present).
#!  @Arguments two simplicial surface objects s1 and s2
#!  @Returns true or false
#!
DeclareOperation( "IsIsomorphic", [IsSimplicialSurface, IsSimplicialSurface] );
