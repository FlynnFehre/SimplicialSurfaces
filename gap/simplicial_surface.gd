#!
#!	@Chapter Simplicial Surfaces
#!
#! A SimplicialSurface-object in GAP represents mathematical objects that are
#! a generalization of simplicial surfaces. On the most basic level it
#! consists of vertices, edges and faces, together with an incidence relation
#! between them. This information is saved in the following form:
#! * the vertices are represented by a set of positive integers
#! * the edges are represented by a set of positive integers
#! * the faces are represented by a set of positive integers
#! * the incidence relation between vertices and edges (that is, which
#!   vertices lie in which edges) is represented by a list VerticesOfEdges.
#!   For each edge e the entry VerticesOfEdges[e] is a set of all vertices
#!   that are incident to the edge e.
#! * the incidence relation between edges and faces (that is, which
#!   edges lie in which faces) is represented by a list EdgesOfFaces. For
#!   each face f the entry EdgesOfFaces[f] is a set of all edges that are
#!   incident to the face f.
#!
#! Every other incidence (like VerticesOfFaces or EdgesOfVertices) is 
#! represented in an analogous fashion.
#!
#! Furthermore we impose some restrictions onto these incidence relations:
#! * Every edge is incident to exactly two vertices
#! * Every face is incident to the same number of vertices and edges (at least
#!   three). Additionally these are cyclically oriented (to represent an 
#!   n-gon)
#! * The incidence relations are transitive
#! * Every vertex and every edge is incident to at least one face
#!
#! Note that it is allowed for an edge to be incident to more than two faces.
#!
#!  
#! In addition it is sometimes necessary to distinguish between the two
#! sides of a single face. If this is irrelevant to your application, you
#! can completely ignore this (it will be handled in the background).
#! To use this distinction each side of a face f gets a name - the defaults
#! are +f and -f (but you can give them custom names if you want to). To 
#! distinguish which side is which (not only by a name, but geometrically)
#! we save a cyclic ordering of the vertices (or edges) of each face which
#! we associate with the side +f. (In an embedding to $\mathbb{R}^3$ we could
#! associate the cyclic ordering with the normal vector of the face that is
#! defined by the right-hand-rule from physics.)

#!  @Section Advanced properties of simplicial surfaces
#!
#!
#! Since the SimplicialSurface-objects in GAP can represent more general
#! structures than just surfaces there is a property that checks whether a
#! generic SimplicialSurface-objects represents an actual surface (the property
#! IsActualSurface).
#!
#! To check whether a generic SimplicialSurface-object represents an actual
#! surface we have to check the edges and the vertices.
#! * In an actual surface every edge is incident to at most two faces. This
#!   property is checked by IsEdgesLikeSurface.
#! * If each edge is incident to at most two faces, we can define
#!   face-edge-paths around each vertex. A face-edge-path around a vertex $v$
#!   is a list $(e_1,f_1,e_2,f_2,\dots,e_n,f_n)$ or 
#!   $(e_1,f_1,e_2,f_2,\dots,e_n,f_n,e_{n+1})$ such that
#!   * all $e_i$ are edges incident to $v$
#!   * all $f_i$ are faces incident to $v$
#!   * if two elements are adjacent in a face-edge-path, they are incident in
#!     the simplicial surface
#!   * if the face-edge-path has even length (the first case), we require that
#!     $e_1$ and $f_n$ are incident (this represents a closed path)
#!   * if the face-edge-path has odd length (the second case), we require that
#!     both $e_1$ and $e_{n+1}$ are only incident to one face (this represents
#!     an open path)
#!   In general there may be many of those paths around a vertex (they 
#!   partition the edges and faces incident to each vertex) but in an actual
#!   surface there is only one such path. The property IsVerticesLikeSurface
#!   checks this property.
#!

#!	@Description
#!	The property IsVerticesLikeSurface is true if the vertices of the simplicial
#!	surface look like edges in a real surface. They do if there is a unique
#!	face-edge-path for each vertex. This is only possible if IsEdgesLikeSurface
#!	is already true.
#!	@Arguments a simplicial surface
#!	@Returns true if the vertices look like those on a surface and false else.

#!	maximum of two faces is incident to that edge.

#!	@Returns true if the edges look like those on a surface and false else.

#!		Objectify( type, rec )
#!	and afterwards copies all attributes and properties of the simplicial
#!	surface modelSurf that are declared in this section to the the new object.
#!	This method has to be overwritten for a specialization of this class.
#!
#!	WARNING: The type can't be checked! Only types that are derived from
#!	IsSimplicialSurface can be used with impunity!
#!
#!	@Arguments a type, a record, a simplicial surface
#!	@Returns an object of type type
DeclareOperation( "ObjectifySimplicialSurface",
		[IsType,IsRecord,IsSimplicialSurface]);


##
#!	@Description
#!	This is a method which should only be used in code development. It should
#!	not be called by a normal user as it presupposes knowledge of the internal
#!	attribute storing system.
#!
#!	A simplicial surface consists of two separate sets of attributes: One set
#!	of attributes to save the incidence geometry (Vertices, Edges, Faces,
#!	EdgesOfFaces, etc.), the other to save the local orientation of the faces
#!	(LocalOrientationOfVerticesAsPerm, NamesOfFaces, etc.). While the second
#!	set of attributes may be crucial for some applications (like folding), it
#!	is easy to ignore it in other applications.
#!	This is usually managed by a judicious constructor call that will handle
#!	the necessary overhead without burdening the user. If - for whatever 
#!	reason - no constructor should be called (for example for a subcategory
#!	of IsSimplicialSurface) this method can be used to initialize all necessary
#!	attributes of the second set.
#! 
#!	This method will throw an error if some of these attributes are already set.
#!	It will only check the attributes
#!		- LocalOrientationByVerticesAsPerm
#!		- LocalOrientationByVerticesAsList
#!		- LocalOrientationByEdgesAsPerm
#!		- LocalOrientationByEdgesAsList
#!		- IsFaceNamesDefault
#!		- NamesOfFaces
#!	If other attributes interfere with these, they will not be checked! For
#!	this reason this method should only be called if one knows exactly which
#!	attributes are already set.
#!
#!	The NC-version doesn't check whether attributes are set (it is therefore
#!	even more dangerous to use).
#!
#!	@Arguments a simplicial surface
#!	@Returns nothing
DeclareOperation( "DeriveLocalOrientationAndFacesNamesFromIncidenceGeometry",
	[IsSimplicialSurface] );
DeclareOperation( "DeriveLocalOrientationAndFacesNamesFromIncidenceGeometryNC",
	[IsSimplicialSurface] );

##
#!	@Description
#!	This function returns both names of the given face. The first entry is
#!	the name of the upper side, the second one of the lower side.
#!	The NC-version doesn't check if the given number actually is a face.
#!	@Arguments a simplicial surface object simpsurf, a face number
#!	@Returns a list with two elements
#!
DeclareOperation( "NamesOfFace", [IsSimplicialSurface, IsPosInt] );
DeclareOperation( "NamesOfFaceNC", [IsSimplicialSurface, IsPosInt] );


##
#!	@Description
#!	Return the face-number of the simplicial surface that has the given name
#!	as the name of one of its sides.
#!	@Arguments a simplicial surface object simpsurf, an integer
#!	@Returns a positive integer
#!
DeclareOperation( "FaceByName", [IsSimplicialSurface, IsInt] );


##
#!	@Description
#!	This function returns the simplicial subsurface that is defined by the
#!	given set of faces.
#!	The NC-version does not check if the given faces actually are faces of
#!	the simplicial surface.
#!	@Arguments a simplicial surface object simpsurf, a set of positive integers
#!	@Returns a simplicial surface object
#!
DeclareOperation( "SubsurfaceByFaces", [IsSimplicialSurface, IsSet] );
DeclareOperation( "SubsurfaceByFacesNC", [IsSimplicialSurface, IsSet] );


##
#!	@Description
#!	This function removes all ears of the simplicial surface and returns
#!	the resulting surface.
#!	@Arguments a simplicial surface object simpsurf
#!	@Returns a simplicial surface object
#!
DeclareOperation( "SnippOffEars", [IsSimplicialSurface] );

##
#!	@Description
#!	This function removes all ears of the simplicial surface. If the resulting
#!	surface still has ears, it removes them as well (and so on). The final
#!	surface is returned..
#!	@Arguments a simplicial surface object simpsurf
#!	@Returns a simplicial surface object
#!
DeclareOperation( "SnippOffEarsRecursive", [IsSimplicialSurface] );

##
#!	@Description
#!	This function returns the connected component of the given face.
#!	The NC-version doesn't check if the given face actually is one.
#!	@Arguments a simplicial surface object simpsurf, a positive integer
#!	@Returns a simplicial surface object
#!
DeclareOperation( "ConnectedComponentOfFace", [IsSimplicialSurface, IsPosInt] );
DeclareOperation( "ConnectedComponentOfFaceNC", [IsSimplicialSurface, IsPosInt] );

##
#!  @Description
#!  Check if two simplicial surfaces are isomorphic. This method only checks
#!	if they are isomorphic with respect to the incidence relation. It does
#!	not check if additional structure like a wild coloring is isomorphic (or
#!	even present).
#!  @Arguments two simplicial surface objects s1 and s2
#!  @Returns true or false
#!
DeclareOperation( "IsIsomorphic", [IsSimplicialSurface, IsSimplicialSurface] );
