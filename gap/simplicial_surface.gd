##
##  This file contains the declaration part for the simplicial surfaces
##	of the SimplicialSurfaces package.
##
##	A SimplicialSurface consists of vertices, edges and faces. Each of those
##	is enumerated by positive integers (not necessarily consecutively).
##	Furthermore we have an incidence relation between them.
##
##	We additionally require a local orientation for each face - that is we
##	want to distinguish its two sides. Therefore we also need names for both
##	sides. The default naming scheme (which will be applied if the user does
##	not explicitly objects) is that the two sides of the face f will be called
##	+f and -f. With this scheme all positive integers represent the "upper
##	sides" and negative integers the "lower sides". A side effect is that the
##	name of a face and of its upper side coincide. It is usually clear from
##	context which one is meant.
##	Mathematically the local orientation is an cycle of the vertices inside
##	a face such that two adjacent vertices in the cycle are also adjacent in
##	the face.
##
##

DeclareInfoClass( "InfoSimplicial" );
SetInfoLevel(InfoSimplicial,1);
# TODO explain structure of everything in a separate tex-file


##
##	Categories are used to determine which methods are applicable for a
##	certain object. The category for simplicial surfaces should be able to
##	save attributes once they are computed (this includes properties) and
##	consists of components.
##
DeclareCategory( "IsSimplicialSurface",
			IsComponentObjectRep and IsAttributeStoringRep );

##
##	Define a new family for simplicial surfaces. The family defines a necessary
##	condition that has to be fulfilled for objects to be equal to each other.
##	The argument IsSimplicialSurface guarantees that only objects that lie in
##	this category can be part of the family.

##
##	This constructor takes the following information:
##
##	The set of vertices (alternatively a number n that becomes [1..n] )
##	The set of edges (alternatively a number n that becomes [1..n] )
##	The set of faces (alternatively a number n that becomes [1..n] )
##	The list EdgesByVertices
##	The list FacesByEdges.
##
##	The local orientation will be set at random and the face naming scheme will
##	be set to default.
##
##	The NoCheck-function does the same thing but does not test if the
##	arguments are well-defined.

##	This constructor takes the following information:
##
##	The set of vertices (alternatively a number n that becomes [1..n] )
##	The set of edges (alternatively a number n that becomes [1..n] )
##	The set of faces (alternatively a number n that becomes [1..n] )
##	The list EdgesByVertices
##	The list FacesByEdges. Each element of this list (that is bound) has to be
##		a list of edges such that two adjacent edges have one vertex in common.
##		This defines an ordering of the edges and therefore an orientation of
##		the face. If we apply this orientation to the vertices we get the 
##		local orientation of this face. If the edge lists are not given in this
##		way, an error is thrown. 
##	Optional: the list NamesOfFaces. If this is not given, the default
##				naming scheme is used
##		To use the optional argument, write
##		SimplicialSurfaceByDownwardIncidence( arg : NamesOfFaces := ? )
##
##	The NoCheck-function does the same thing but does not test if the
