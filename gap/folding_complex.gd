##  This file contains the declaration part for the folding complexes
##	of the SimplicialSurfaces package.
##
##	A folding complex consists of the following information:
##		- a SimplicialSurface that describes the underlying structure
##		- an equivalence relation on vertices, edges and faces that describes
##			which of those are folded together
##		- a fan for each edge equivalence class, i.e. a cycle of the incident
##			faces that depends on the orientation of the edge
##		- two face sides for each face equivalence class that describe the
##			borders of this equivalence class
