##  This file contains the declaration part for the folding complexes
##	of the SimplicialSurfaces package.
##
##	A folding complex consists of the following information:
##		- a SimplicialSurface that describes the underlying structure
##		- an equivalence relation on vertices, edges and faces that describes
##			which of those are folded together
##		- a fan for each edge equivalence class, i.e. a cycle of the incident
##			faces that depends on the orientation of the edge
##		- two face sides for each face equivalence class that describe the
##			borders of this equivalence class

#!	@Description
#!	Return a folding complex that is based on the given simplicial surface. All
#!	other properties are uniquely defined if we start with an actual surface.
#!	@Arguments a simplicial surface that is an actual surface
#!	@Returns a folding complex
DeclareOperation( "FoldingComplex", [IsSimplicialSurface and IsActualSurface]);


#!	@Description
#!	Return a folding complex that is based on the given simplicial surface.
#!	Furthermore we give some fans in form of a list that is indexed by the
#!	edges of the simplicial surface. If a fan is not given in this list, we
#!	try to define it uniquely by checking the surface. If this is not possible
#!	we throw an error.
#!	The NC-version doesn't check if the given list consists of fans that match
#!	the surface.
#!	@Arguments a simplicial surface and a list
#!	@Returns a folding complex
DeclareOperation( "FoldingComplex", [IsSimplicialSurface, IsList] );
DeclareOperation( "FoldingComplexNC", [IsSimplicialSurface, IsList] );


#!	@Description
#!	Return a folding complex that is based on the given simplicial surface with
#!	equivalence. Furthermore we give some fans in form of a list that is 
#!	indexed by the edge equivalence class numbers of the simplicial surface
#!	with equivalence. If a fan is not given in this list, we try to define it
#!	uniquely by checking the surface. If this is not possible we throw an error.
#!
#!	The NC-version doesn't check if the given list consists of fans that match
#!	the surface.
#!	@Arguments a simplicial surface with equivalence and a list
#!	@Returns a folding complex
