##  This file contains the declaration part for the folding plans of the 
##	SimplicialSurfaces package. A folding plan consists of an identification
##	and two oriented faces belongig to the identified faces.

##
##	Define a new family for folding plans. The family
##	defines a necessary condition that has to be fulfilled for objects to be 
##	equal to each other. The argument IsFoldingPlan 
##	guarantees that only objects that lie in this category can be part of the 
##	family.

#!	@Description
#!	Return a folding plan based on an identification and a list of two 
#!	oriented faces (integers).
#!	The NC-version doesn't check whether the list actually consists of exactly
#!	two integers.
#!	@Arguments a simplicial surface identification, a tuple of integers
#!	@Returns a folding plan
DeclareOperation( "FoldingPlanByIdentification", 
					[IsSimplicialSurfaceIdentification, IsList] );
DeclareOperation( "FoldingPlanByIdentificationNC", 
					[IsSimplicialSurfaceIdentification, IsList] );

#!	@Description
#!	Return a folding plan based on four maps. The first three define the
#!	identification, the last one is the oriented face map.
#!
#!	The NC-version doesn't check whether the number of elements in these 
#!	maps match (3 vertices, 3 edges, 1 face, 1 oriented face).
#!
#!	@Arguments four bijective maps: for vertices, edges, faces and oriented
#!		faces
#!	@Returns a folding plan
DeclareOperation( "FoldingPlanByMaps", [IsMapping and IsBijective, IsMapping 
	and IsBijective, IsMapping and IsBijective, IsMapping and IsBijective]);
DeclareOperation( "FoldingPlanByMapsNC", [IsMapping and IsBijective, IsMapping 
	and IsBijective, IsMapping and IsBijective, IsMapping and IsBijective]);

#!	@Description
#!	Return a folding plan that is constructed from four lists. The vertex-list 
#!	has the form [[p_1,q_1],[p_2,q_2],[p_3,q_3]] and corresponds to the map 
#!	p_i -> q_i. Analogously for the other three lists.
#!
#!	The NC-version does not check if the lists fulfill this format or if the
#!	number of elements match or if the resulting maps are bijective.
#!
#!	@Arguments three lists of tuples of positive integers, one list of tuples
#!		of integers
#!	@Returns a folding plan
DeclareOperation( "FoldingPlanByLists", [IsList,IsList,IsList,IsList]);

#!	@Description
#!	Return if the given folding plan is well-defined with respect to the given 
#!	simplicial surface.
#!	This method checks if the maps of the identification can be applied to
#!	the vertices, edges and faces of the underlying simplicial surface. It also
#!	checks whether the maps are compatible with each other, i.e. if they
#!	commute with the incidence relation of the simplicial surface.
#!	Finally it checks whether the oriented faces are face names of the given
#!	faces.
#!	@Arguments a folding complex or a simplicial surface, a folding plan
#!	@Returns true or false
DeclareOperation( "IsWellDefinedFoldingPlan", 
	[IsSimplicialSurface, IsFoldingPlan] );




#!	@Description
#!	Return whether the given folding plan can be applied to the given folding
#!	complex. This method only checks the formal qualifiers from definition
#!	3.71 in my master thesis. It does not check whether the application of
#!	this folding plan actually yields a proper folding complex. TODO fix this
#!
#!	The NC-version does not check whether the given folding plan is well
#!	defined with respect to the given folding complex.
#!
#!	@Arguments a folding complex, a folding plan
#!	@Returns true or false
DeclareOperation( "IsApplicableFoldingPlan", 
	[IsFoldingComplex, IsFoldingPlan] );
DeclareOperation( "IsApplicableFoldingPlanNCWellDefined", 
	[IsFoldingComplex, IsFoldingPlan] );


#!	@Description
#!	Apply the folding plan to the folding complex. This method returns fail
#!	if this is not possible or if the application does not yield a proper
#!	folding complex. Otherwise return the new folding complex.
#!
#!	The NC-version does not check IsApplicableFoldingPlan before constructing
#!	the result.
#!
#!	@Arguments a folding complex, a folding plan
#!	@Returns a folding complex or fail
