##
##	TODO description of wild coloured simplicial surfaces
##
##  There are several ways of inputting a wild coloured simplicial surface.
##
##  A wild coloured simplicial surface is created by the function 
##  WildSimplicialSurface and is a GAP object. Simplicial surfaces can be 
##  obtained as follows:
##
##  1) Given a triple gens of involutions, the function
##     AllWildSimplicialSurfaces(gens)  computes  all wild coloured simplicial 
##     surfaces whose faces are the moved points of the generators and whose
##     edges are determined by the 2-cycles of the generators.
##  2) Input a surface by first listing the faces, 
##     then pairs of faces making up the edges, 
##     then the face-paths for  each vertex.  A face-path is simply
##     a list of the faces in the order in which they occur around a vertex.
##     The function WildSimplicialSurfacesFromFacePath takes this input
##     and returns all wild coloured simplicial surfaces matching the
##     description
##  3) Input a wild coloured surface by the following data structure, 
##     called the *generic-surface* data structure. The generic-surface
##     data structure is the most general data structure to describe
##     surfaces and is not restricted to wild coloured surfaces only.
##     The generic-surface data structure is a list of
##      the number of vertices, edges and faces
##      then pairs of vertices making up the edges, 
##      then triples of edges making up the faces, e.g.
##      ( |V|, |E|, |F|, [ [v1,v2],...],  [[e1,e2,e3],... ] )
##       here ei is a number, which is a position in the list of edges,
##       so that the list of vertex pairs can be indexed by ei to find
##       the two vertex numbers of edges ei.
##     
##
##
##    As GAP objects, certain general methods are installed for 
##    simplicial surface objects, such as Print and Display and "=".
##
##    The mr-type of a wild coloured simplicial surface simpsurf
##    can be determined with the function MrTypeOfWildSimplicialSurface.
##
##    As Simplicial surfaces are GAP objects, they cannot be 
##    accessed like records.
##
##    An action of a permutation on a simplicial surface is installed, 
##    allowing us to compute the orbits of a group acting on a set of
##    simplicial surfaces.
##

#!	@Chapter Wild Simplicial Surfaces

##
##	Wild simplicial surfaces are simplicial surfaces that have additional
##	structure. Since not every simplicial surface admits a unique wild 
##	colouring, we don't define it as an attribute but rather as a separate
##	object (which is encoded as a category).

#!  @Description 
#!	Given a wild coloured simplicial surface simpsurf, this
#!  function determines the mr-type of each of the edges of simpsurf.
#!  The mr-type of an edge of simpsurf is either "m" (for mirror) or 
#!  "r" (for rotation). It is defined as followed. 
#!  Suppose the edge  $e$ is incident to the vertices $v_1$ and 
#!  $v_2$ and to the two faces $F$ and $F'$. Let $x$ and $y$ be the edges of
#!  incident  incident to $F$ and $F'$ and to the same vertex $v_1$, say.
#!  Then $e$ is of type $m$ if both $x$ and $y$ have the same colour, and $e$
#!  is of type $r$ if $x$ and $y$ are different. As we assume the surface to
#!  be wild coloured, this means that the colours of the other edges incident 
#!  to $e$ and both faces $F$ and $F'$ are then also determined. As the # $'$
#!  edges of the simplicial surface are pairs of points, the mr-type of 
#!  the simplicial surface simpsurf can be encoded as a list of length 3. 
#!   Each of the
#!  entries is in turn  a list encoding the mr-type of all edges of a 
#!  certain colour. Suppose that mrtype[1] is the list encoding the mr-type
#!  of the red edges. Then mrtype[1][i] = 0 if the mr-type of the red edge
#!  incident to the vertex i is unknown, mrtype[1][i] = 1 if the mr-type of 
#!  the red edge incident to the vertex i is "m", and mrtype[1][i] = 2 if 
#!  the mr-type of the red edge incident to the vertex i is "r".
#!  @Arguments simpsurf, a simplicial surface object as created 
#!  by WildSimplicialSurface 
#!  @Returns a list of three lists, each of which contains the 
#!  entries 0, 1 or 2.

#!   @Description
#!   The function SixFoldCover takes as input a generic description of
#!   a simplicial surface.  The six fold cover of a simplicial surface is
#!   the following surface.
#!   If f is a face of the original face with edge numbers e_a, e_b and
#!   e_c, then the face is covered by the six faces of the form
#!   (f, e1, e2, e3), for which {e1, e2, e3}  = {e_a, e_b, e_c}.
#!   See Proposition 3.XX in the paper.
#!   @Arguments
#!
#!   If the optional argument mrtype is given, it has to be a list of length 
#!   3 and each entry has to be  $1$, or $2$. In this case the six fold cover 
#!   will treat the position $i$ for $i\in\{1,2,3\}$ of the three
#!   edges around a faces either as a   reflection (mirror), if the entry 
#!   in position $i$ of mrtype is 1, or as a rotation, if the entry in 
#!   position $i$ is 2. That is, the cover surface is generated by three
#!   transpositions $\sigma_i$ for $i=1,2,3$. For $i=1$, suppose $f$ and 
#!   $f'$ are faces of the surface surf such that the edges of $f$ are 
#!   $e_1, e_2$  and $e_3$ and the edges of $f'$ are  $e_1, e_a, e_b$ are 
#!   the edges $e_1, e_2$ and $e_a$ intersect in a common vertex and 
#!   the edges $e_1, e_3$ and $e_b$ intersect in a common vertex.
#!   For $i=1$ and  mrtype of position $1$ being  mirror (i.e. $1$), then 
#!   $$\sigma_1(f,e_1,e_2,e_3) = (f', e_1, e_a, e_b),$$ whereas if the 
#!   mrtype of position $1$ is a reflection (i.e. $2$), then 
#!   $$\sigma_1(f,e_1,e_2,e_3) = (f', e_1, e_b, e_a).$$ The definition
#!   of $\sigma_2$ and $\sigma_3$ are analogous, with $e_2$, respectively
#!   $e_3$ taking the role of the common edge $e_1.$
#!
#!   
#!   If the optional argument mredges is given, and mredges is a list of 
#!   length equal to the number of edges of the surface **surf** and an
#!   entry for an edge e is either 1 or 2. If the entry is 1 then 
#!   the six fold cover will treat the edge as a reflection (mirror) and 
#!   if the entry is 2  then the edge is treated as a rotation. 
#!
#!   The six fold cover is always a wild colourable simplicial surface.
#!   @Returns a wild coloured simplicial surface
#!   @Arguments surface, mrtype, bool
#!   if bool is true or not given, the mrtype specifies the behaviour of 
#!   the $\sigma_i$, if bool is false, the mrtype specifies the behaviour
#!   of the edges.

#!  @Description
#!  This function computes all wild-coloured simplicial surfaces generated
#!  by a triple of involutions as specified in the input. If the optional
#!  argument mrtype is present, only those wit a predefined mrtype are
#!  constructed.
#!  The involution triple can be given to the function in various ways.
#!  Either they are input as a list gens of three involutions, or as
#!  a group grp whose generators are the tree involutions, or they can
#!  be input into the function as three arguments, one for each involution.
#! 
#!  In case the optional argument mrtype  is present, it can be used to
#!  restrict to wild-colourings for which some or all edges have a predefined
#!  colour. This is equivalent to marking the cycles of the three involutions
#!  as follows. If the edge $(j, j^\sigma_i)$ of the involution $\sigma_i$ is
#!  to be a reflection (mirror) let $k=1$, if it is to be a rotation, let 
#!  $k=2$ and if it can be either let $k=0.$ Then set $mrtype[i][j] = k$.
#!  @Returns a list of all wild-coloured simplicial surfaces with generating
#!  set given by three involutions.
#!  The function AllWildSimplicialSurfaces when called with the optional argument
#!  mrtype now returns all wild-coloured simplicial surfaces whose edges
#!  are coloured according to the restrictions imposed by mrtype.
#!  @Arguments gens,  a list of three involutions

#!  @Description
#!  This function takes as input a ``face"- description of a surface. 
#!  A ``face"-description of a surface is as  follows.
#!
#!  A list surf with three entries:
#!  * a list of integers, the faces, 
#!  * a list of  pairs of faces making up the edges, 
#!  * a list of  face-paths, one face-path for  each vertex. 
#!  A face-path is a list of on a vertex in the order in which they occur
#!  in the vertex. Note that in this representation it is critical that a 
#!  closed face-path is represented by a list of faces that repeats the 
#!  starting face at the end! That means  the first and last face in the
#!  list of faces for the given face-path **must** be equal, otherwise 
#!  the face-path is assumed to be a path from a face with boundary to 
#!  another face with boundary around a fixed vertex.
#!   Thus the ``face"-description has the form
#!  surf := [ [f1, f2, ..., fn, f1],  [ [f1,f2],...],  [[f1,f2,f3,...],... ];
#!  This is a very simple way of inputting a simplicial surface by just 
#!  reading off the face numbers of each  vertex.
#!
#!
#!  @BeginExample the tetrahedron is represented as
#!    tetra := [ [1..4], [[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[3,4],[2,4]],
#!             [[1,2,3,1], [1,3,4,1],[1,2,4,1],[2,3,4,2]];
#!    WildWildSimplicialSurfacesFromFacePath(tetra);
#!             where the triple [1,2,3,1] encodes the face path
#!              around one vertex.
#!  @EndExample
#!
#!  @Returns  the list of all wild coloured simplicial surfaces with these 
#!  specifications.
#!  @Arguments a list of lists, representing a ``face"-description of a surface
