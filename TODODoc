@Gutsche:
    If an operation is declared with an empty argument list, it will be labeled as
        Oper( for  )
            Oper( args )
    This can be fixed manually by adding
        @Arguments
        @Label
    but there should be a nicer way to handle this exception.

@Frank:
    If you include LaTeX-Code via the alt-tag, the given lines are completely permuted.
    This has a big influence if there are some comments in there.
