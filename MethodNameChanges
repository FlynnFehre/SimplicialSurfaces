Changelog from master to rewrite (hopefully mostly complete)

For simplicial surfaces:
    1) Huge change in the category-structure; introduction of polygonal 
        complexes. Refer to chapter "Polygonal Structures" for details.
    2) NrOf* is replaced by NumberOf*
    3) IsTriangleSurface is replaced by IsTriangularComplex
    4) PathConnected* is replaced by StronglyConnected*, see section
        "Connectivity" for details.
    5) UnsortedDegrees is replaced by EdgeDegreesOfVertices and 
        FaceDegreesOfVertices. SortedDegrees is removed entirely.
    6) *Counter changed their definition and return values. Refer
        to the respective documentation for details.
    7) IncidenceGraph is replaced by more specific calls to the
        respective graph packages. Refer to chapter "Graphs and isomorphisms"
        for details.
    8) IsomorphismCheck is now done by IsIsomorphicPolygonalComplexes.
    9) IsVerticesLikeSurface, IsEdgesLikeSurface and IsActualSurface are
        removed. Use the apprpriate categories from chapter
        "Polygonal Structures".
    10) FaceEdgePathsOfVertices is replaced by UmbrellasOfVertices.
        See section "Edge-Face-Paths" for details of the new data structure.
    11) LocalOrientation* is replaced by PerimeterOfFaces. Refer to section
        "Face-induced order of incident vertices/edges".
    12) NamesOfFaces are removed. They will be reintroduced when surfaces
        can be folded properly.
    13) GlobalOrientation is replaced by Orientation. See section 
        "Orientability" for all corresponding changes.
    14) ObjectifySimplicialSurface is removed.
    15) DeriveLocalOrientation* is removed.
    16) AllFlags is replaced by Flags (compare chapter "Flags")
    17) Dress*Involution are replaced by DressInvolutions
    18) SubsurfaceByFaces is replaced by SubcomplexByFaces
    19) ConnectedSum is replaced by ConnectedFaceSum
    20) SnippOffEarsRecursively was removed since it was unused.
    21) *Cut/Mend is changed in its calls. Please refer to section
        "Example: Cut and Mend" for details
    22) Geodesic is replaced by MaximalGeodesicOfFlag
    23) Geodesics is replaces by MaximalGeodesics
    24) MaximalStripEmbedding is replaces by MaximalDuplicateFreeGeodesics
        and MaximalDuplicateFreeGeodesicOfFlag
    25) The previous FlagSurface is replaced by IsomorphicFlagSurface
        and called differently. Refer to the manual for details.



For wild simplicial surfaces:
    1) complete rewrite. Refer to the chapters about edge colouring for details.
    2) DoubleCover is now called OrientationCover and available for all
        ramified polygonal surfaces.
    3) FilteredStructures* is removed
    4) AllStructures is replaced by AllTameColouredSurfaces
    5) WildIsomorphismRepresentatives is replaced by 
        EdgeColouredPolygonalComplexIsomorphismRepresentatives
