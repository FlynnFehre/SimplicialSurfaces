Changelog from master to rewrite (hopefully mostly complete)

For simplicial surfaces:
    1) Huge change in the category-structure, introduction of polygonal 
        complexes. Refer to chapter "Polygonal Structures" for details.
    2) NrOf* is replaced by NumberOf*
    3) IsTriangleSurface is replaced by IsTriangularComplex
    4) PathConnected* is replaced by StronglyConnected*, see section
        "Connectivity" for details.
    5) UnsortedDegrees is replaced by EdgeDegreesOfVertices and 
        FaceDegreesOfVertices, SortedDegrees is removed entirely.
    6) *Counter changed their definition and return values. Refer
        to the respective documentation for details.
    7) IncidenceGraph is replaced by more specific calls to the
        respective graph packages. Refer to chapter "Graphs and isomorphisms"
        for details.
    8) IsomorphismCheck is now done by IsIsomorphicPolygonalComplexes.
    9) IsVerticesLikeSurface, IsEdgesLikeSurface and IsActualSurface are
        removed. Use the relevant categories from chapter
        "Polygonal Structures".
    10) FaceEdgePathsOfVertices is replaced by UmbrellasOfVertices.
        See section "Edge-Face-Paths" for details of the new data structure.
    11) LocalOrientation* is replaced by PerimeterOfFaces. Refer to section
        "Face-induced order of incident vertices/edges".
    12) NamesOfFaces are removed. They will be reintroduced when surfaces
        can be folded properly.
    13) GlobalOrientation is replaced by Orientation. See section 
        "Orientability" for all corresponding changes.
    14) ObjectifySimplicialSurface is removed.
    15) DeriveLocalOrientation* is removed.



For wild simplicial surfaces:
    1) complete rewrite. Refer to the chapters about edge colouring for details.
