JoinPerimeters(complex, path1, path2)
    -> if the paths are not complete, they will be completed to the full perimeter
    -> can also be given as [vertex, edge] or [edge, edge] or [vertex,vertex] if that specifies the perimeter uniquely
    -> return fail if it is not possible (internally)
    -> Error if perimeters have different length
