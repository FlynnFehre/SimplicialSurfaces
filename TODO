Chapter Embedding:
StripEmbedding?

Chapter Modifications:
DualSurface
AddVertexIntoEdge [Jesse]


Display: immer Umbrellas (bei EdgeColoured nur gefÃ¤rbt @Frank/Gutsche: Kann man Konsolenausgabe farbig machen?)
    -> everything coloured (OnOff-Switch)
    -> colorprompt.g for application -> Can this be done via DisplayString? Or write Display explicitly?
    -> in general give vertices, edges and faces different colours and display those


ColourNames -> View/Display for colouring
AllWild... -> IsomorphicFlagSurface

Cover

Geodesics
    Have GeodesicFlagPermutation as an attribute of geodesics
    Have MaximalStripEmbedding(geodesic, face) an operation
    -> In long term split chapter "Paths and Orientations"
        -> One chapter for vertex-edge-paths
        -> One chapter for edge-face-paths (maybe even one for geodesics if geodesic duality is concerned)
        -> Unclear where connectivity and orientability should end up
