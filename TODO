Coloured output:
    -> Change implementation in GAP (FormatOutput in
        https://github.com/gap-system/gap/blob/master/src/io.c )
    -> Maybe switch to a different hack: open stdout in IO and turn off formatting

    -> In long term split chapter "Paths and Orientations"
        -> One chapter for vertex-edge-paths
        -> One chapter for edge-face-paths (maybe even one for geodesics if geodesic duality is concerned)
        -> Unclear where connectivity and orientability should end up


Cover: Return complex and new vertices, edges, faces
SixFoldCover
IsomorphicFlagSurface
Geodesic: Computation of MaximalGeodesics, MaximalStripEmbedding as operation


Modification:
    AddVertexIntoEdge etc.
