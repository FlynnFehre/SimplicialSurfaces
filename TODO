Coloured output:
    -> Change implementation in GAP (FormatOutput in
        https://github.com/gap-system/gap/blob/master/src/io.c )
    -> Maybe switch to a different hack: open stdout in IO and turn off formatting

    -> In long term split chapter "Paths and Orientations"
        -> One chapter for vertex-edge-paths
        -> One chapter for edge-face-paths (maybe even one for geodesics if geodesic duality is concerned)
        -> Unclear where connectivity and orientability should end up

Better inclusion of covers:
    -> maybe by map cover->surface ?
    -> where are vertices, edges, faces represented?

Modification (mid-term):
    AddVertexIntoEdge etc.


evtl. Coloured labels in drawing method?? LabelColour?


Set up Travis/Codecov as soon as the repository turns public
    -> Use travis.yml and codecov.yml from other packages
    -> Together with directory "scripts"

Set up package website with GitHubPagesForGAP (script setup.sh)
    https://github.com/gap-system/GitHubPagesForGAP
