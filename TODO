Coloured output:
    -> Change implementation in GAP (FormatOutput in
        https://github.com/gap-system/gap/blob/master/src/io.c )
    -> Maybe switch to a different hack: open stdout in IO and turn off formatting

    -> In long term split chapter "Paths and Orientations"
        -> One chapter for vertex-edge-paths
        -> One chapter for edge-face-paths (maybe even one for geodesics if geodesic duality is concerned)
        -> Unclear where connectivity and orientability should end up

Better inclusion of covers:
    -> maybe by map cover->surface ?
    -> where are vertices, edges, faces represented?

Modification (mid-term):
    AddVertexIntoEdge etc.


Profile Classification script: Step 18 -> 20
 and optimize
    -> Pull-Request auf NautyTracesInterface Zeile 22 in *NodeLabels* (etc.)
    -> ListWithIdenticalEntries
    -> List is slower than a for-loop (factor 2..)
    -> TransitiveIncidence with loop in list (write in position) and perform Set
    -> BoundPositions replaced by loop (with separate counting variable)
    -> Replace Filtered in general in this fashion (maybe write a custom filtered?)
    -> Improve OnTuplesTuples (PR): lines 362 in NautyGraph.gi (and in general)
        -> Evtly PR against library?
    => Custom Union, Filtered, List commands
    -> Replace ValueGlobal by Kernel command (or PR with NC) in Scheduler


evtl. Coloured labels in drawing method?? LabelColour?
