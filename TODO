    -> In long term split chapter "Paths and Orientations"
        -> One chapter for vertex-edge-paths
        -> One chapter for edge-face-paths (maybe even one for geodesics if geodesic duality is concerned)
        -> Unclear where connectivity and orientability should end up


Cover: Return complex and new vertices, edges, faces
SixFoldCover
IsomorphicFlagSurface
Geodesic: Computation of MaximalGeodesics, MaximalStripEmbedding as operation
AllTame: Rearrange methods to make this computation efficient


Modification:
    AddVertexIntoEdge etc.
