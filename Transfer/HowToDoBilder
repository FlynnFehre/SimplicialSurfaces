This is a short explanation of the process to compile tikz-code into 
svg-images (that can then be included into an html-page)

1. Install tex4ht
2. Write your LaTeX-Code. Of special importance is the line 
    \def\pgfsysdriver{pgfsys-tex4ht.def}. An example is given in 
    HTML_BildTest.tex 
3. Compile the code with htlatex <name>. This will return an svg (a
    scalable vector graphic) with the name <name>-1.svg (The number increases
    if there are multiple pictures in one file).
