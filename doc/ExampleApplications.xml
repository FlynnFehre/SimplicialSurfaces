<Chapter Label="ExampleApplications"><Heading>Example Applications</Heading>
    This chapter contains examples of several advanced applications
    for the <K>SimplicialSurface</K>--package. It mainly serves as a
    guideline that shows which problems can be solved by the package.
    If it uses many unclear terms, it is recommended to skip this chapter.

        <Heading>Constructing a complicated surface from a simple one</Heading>
        In this section, we want to construct the following surface:
        <Enum>
            <Item>Start with a spherical surface that has 10 faces,
                two vertices of degree 5 and five vertices of degree 4,
                such that the two vertices of degree 5 are not adjacent.</Item>
            <Item>Pick two adjacent faces that are not incident to the
                same vertex of degree 5 and ``stack'' an octahedron onto them.</Item>
            <Item>Compute the automorphism group of the resulting surface.</Item>
            <Item>Remove the unique vertex that is fixed by the 
                whole automorphism group.</Item>
        </Enum>

        A tedious way would be to construct this surface by hand, label
        all vertices, edges, and faces, and use one of the methods
        from chapter <Ref Chap="Chapter_Constructors"/> to construct the 
        surface.

        Instead, we can also follow the guidelines to construct the surface.
        First, we have to obtain the spherical surface. Since the two vertices
        of degree 5 are not adjacent, the faces incident to them are distinct.
        We can construct those by the method <K>SimplicialUmbrella</K>
        (<Ref Subsect="SimplicialUmbrella"/>):
<Example>
gap&gt; umb5 := SimplicialUmbrella(5);
simplicial surface (6 vertices, 10 edges, and 5 faces)
</Example>
        Since two of these umbrellas have 10 faces in total, we
        can construct the surface from two umbrellas. We can do
        so by identifying their boundaries. This process is known
        as <E>joining</E> and the relevant methods are documented
        in section <Ref Sect="Section_Modification_Joining"/>.
        For our purpose, we need 
        <K>JoinBoundaries</K> (<Ref Subsect="JoinBoundaries"/>).

        This method requires a vertex and an edge of each umbrella,
        that lie on the boundary and are incident to each other.
        The easiest way would be to look up the labelling in
        the documentation of <K>SimplicialUmbrella</K> 
        (<Ref Subsect="SimplicialUmbrella"/>), but we can also find
        one of them ourselves:
<Example>
gap&gt; boundaryEdges := BoundaryEdges(umb5);
[ 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ]
gap&gt; verts := VerticesOfEdge(umb5, 6);
[ 1, 2 ]
</Example>
        Therefore, 1 is a boundary vertex incident to the boundary
        edge 6. This allows us to join the boundaries of two
        umbrellas.
<Example>
gap&gt; join := JoinBoundaries(umb5, [1,6], umb5, [1,6]);
[ simplicial surface (7 vertices, 15 edges, and 10 faces), 
    ( v17, E21, v18, E22, v19, E23, v20, E24, v21, E25, v17 )
    , 10 ]
gap&gt; doubleFiveGon := join[1];
simplicial surface (7 vertices, 15 edges, and 10 faces)
</Example>
        The second component of <A>join</A> is a vertex-edge-path
        (compare section <Ref Sect="Section_Paths_VertexEdge"/>)
        that describes how the old boundary lies in the new surface.
        In particular, <M>E21</M> tells us that edge 21 was a
        boundary edge before the joining. Therefore, the two faces
        adjacent to that edge are not incident to the same vertex
        of degree 5.
<Example>
gap&gt; adjFaces := FacesOfEdge(doubleFiveGon, 21);
[1, 11]
</Example>
        Next, we want to ``stack'' an octahedron onto each of
        these faces. We can construct an octahedron directly
        by calling <K>Octahedron</K> (<Ref Subsect="Octahedron"/>),
        and we can ``stack'' two surfaces by using
        <K>ConnectedFaceSum</K> (<Ref Subsect="ConnectedFaceSum"/>).

        Unfortunately, this method requires a flag of each surface
        (it needs to know how exactly we want to combine
        the surfaces). Since the octahedron is highly symmetric,
        all possible choices lead to the same surface. For the flag
        of <A>doubleFiveGon</A> we already have an edge (21) and a
        face (1 and 11). We only need a vertex incident to the edge.
<Example>
gap&gt; VerticesOfEdge(doubleFiveGon, 21);
[ 17, 18 ]
</Example>
        For the octahedron, we can use any flag. We can use
        <K>Flags</K> (<Ref Subsect="ThreeFlags"/>) to compute all of
        them.
<Example>
gap&gt; octa := Octahedron();
simplicial surface (6 vertices, 12 edges, and 8 faces)
gap&gt; octaFlag := Flags(octa)[1];
[ 1, 1, 1 ]
</Example>
        This allows the first combination.
<Example>
gap&gt; faceSum1 := ConnectedFaceSum(doubleFiveGon, [17,21,1], octa, [1,1,1]);
simplicial surface (10 vertices, 24 edges, and 16 faces)
gap&gt; [ 17, 21, 11 ] in Flags(faceSum1);
false
</Example>
        Such a combination might force a partical relabelling of the 
        surface and in our case, this has happened: the triple <M>[17,21,11]</M>
        is no flag of the new surface.

        TODO this is very annoying
