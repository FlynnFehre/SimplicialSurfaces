    Although we are mostly interested in surfaces, the process of folding 
    naturally leads us to more general structures. Therefore, the most general 
    structure that we consider in this package is a polygonal complex (a 
    generalisation of simplicial surfaces and complexes).
    <Par/>
    Polygonal Complexes are structures that are build from polygons (for the exact
    definition, see section ...), like

    Since we are especially interested in surfaces we need a way to recognize
    them. For technical reasons we split this process into two separate steps,
    with the ramified polygonal surfaces as the intermediate structure betwee
    polygonal complexes and polygons surfaces.
    In many cases the definitions and algorithms simplify if we only consider
    triangles instead of general polygons. For this reason we also have equivalents
    of these structures that are only build from triangles. We can summarize
    the relationships graphically (higher means more general):
