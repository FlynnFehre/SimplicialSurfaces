    Although we are mostly interested in surfaces, the process of folding 
    naturally leads us to more general structures. Therefore, the most general 
    structure that we consider in this package is a polygonal complex (a 
    generalisation of simplicial surfaces and complexes).
    <Par/>
    Polygonal Complexes are structures that are build from polygons (for the exact
    definition, see section ...), like

        \input{Image_ManyExamples.tex}
    </Alt>
    Since we are especially interested in surfaces we need a way to recognize
    them. For technical reasons we split this process into two separate steps,
    with the ramified polygonal surfaces as the intermediate structure betwee
    polygonal complexes and polygons surfaces.
    <Par/>
    In many cases the definitions and algorithms simplify if we only consider
    triangles instead of general polygons. For this reason we also have equivalents
    of these structures that are only build from triangles. We can summarize
    the relationships graphically (higher means more general):

        A polygonal complex is defined by a two-dimensional incidence geometry
        that fulfills some regularity conditions. We will exemplify this by 
        the following surface.
        <Alt Only="TikZ">
            \input{Image_StarOfStarExample.tex}
        </Alt>
        In a two-dimensional incidence geometry we have a set <M>V</M> of
        vertices, a set <M>E</M> of edges and a set <M>F</M> of faces. If we label
        our picture like this,
        <Alt Only="TikZ">
            {
                \def\allLabels{1}
                \input{Image_StarOfStarExample.tex}
            }
        </Alt>
        we have the sets
        <!-- TODO this looks really crappy in LaTeX..-->
        <Par/>
        <M>V = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}</M>
        <Par/>
        <M>E = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}</M>
        <Par/>
        <M>F = \{I, II\}</M>.
        <Par/>
        These sets can't encode the surface on their own. We also need the 
        relations between vertices, edges and faces. For that we define a 
        transitive relation in the union of <M>V \times E</M>, 
        <M>V \times F</M> and <M>E \times F</M>, where <M>(a,b)</M> is in the 
        relation if and only if <M>a</M> is incident to <M>b</M>.
        Since the relation is transitive, it is sufficient to give the tuples
        <!-- TODO "give" is a bad word - what is better? -->
        in <M>V \times E</M> and <M>E \times F</M>. In our example the 
        relation would be generated by
        <Par/>
        <M>\{ (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (2,6), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4),
            (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)\}</M>
        <Par/>
        and
        <Par/>
        <M>\{ (1,I), (2,I), (3,I), (3,II), (4,II), (5,II), (6,II) \}</M>.
        <Par/>
