<#GAPDoc Label="PolygonalComplex_Edge">
For every edge there should be exactly two vertices that are incident to it.
<#/GAPDoc>

<#GAPDoc Label="PolygonalComplex_Edge_simple">
Every edge has exactly two incident vertices.
<#/GAPDoc>

<#GAPDoc Label="PolygonalComplex_Face">
For every face the number of incident vertices is equal to the number
of incident edges. Additionally there is an enumeration of the vertices
(<M>v_1, v_2, ..., v_k</M>) and the edges 
(<M>e_1, e_2, ..., e_k</M>) such that the
vertices <M>v_i</M> and <M>v_{{i+1}}</M> are incident to the
edge <M>e_i</M> (where we read indices <M>\bmod k</M>).

<#GAPDoc Label="PolygonalComplex_Face_simple">
For every face the incident edges and vertices form a polygon.
<#/GAPDoc>
<!--TODO link to the complete definition-->
<#GAPDoc Label="TriangularComplex_Face_simple">
For every face the incident edges and vertices form a triangle.
<#/GAPDoc>

<#GAPDoc Label="PolygonalComplex_Incidence">
Every vertex is incident to an edge and every edge is incident to a face.

<#GAPDoc Label="PolygonalComplex_Definition">
A <K>polygonal complex</K> is a two-dimensional incidence geometry consisting 
of vertices, edges and faces such that the following conditions hold:
<Enum>
    <Item><#Include Label="PolygonalComplex_Edge"></Item>
    <Item><#Include Label="PolygonalComplex_Face"></Item>
    <Item><#Include Label="PolygonalComplex_Incidence"></Item>
</Enum>
A <K>triangular complex</K> is a polygonal complex where every face has
exactly three incident vertices.
