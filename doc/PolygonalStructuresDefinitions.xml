<#GAPDoc Label="PolygonalComplex_Edge">
For every edge there should be exactly two vertices that are incident to it.
<#/GAPDoc>

<#GAPDoc Label="PolygonalComplex_Edge_simple">
Every edge has exactly two incident vertices.
<#/GAPDoc>

<#GAPDoc Label="PolygonalComplex_Face">
For every face the number of incident vertices is equal to the number
of incident edges. Additionally there is an enumeration of the vertices
(<M>v_1, v_2, ..., v_k</M>) and the edges 
(<M>e_1, e_2, ..., e_k</M>) such that the
vertices <M>v_i</M> and <M>v_{{i+1}}</M> are incident to the
edge <M>e_i</M> (where we read indices <M>\bmod k</M>).
<#/GAPDoc>

<#GAPDoc Label="PolygonalComplex_Face_simple">
For every face the incident edges and vertices form a polygon (see
definition <Ref Subsect="Def_PolygonalComplex"/>).

<!--TODO link to the complete definition-->
<#GAPDoc Label="TriangularComplex_Face_simple">
For every face the incident edges and vertices form a triangle (see
definition <Ref Subsect="Def_PolygonalComplex"/>).
<#/GAPDoc>

<#GAPDoc Label="PolygonalComplex_Incidence">
Every vertex is incident to an edge and every edge is incident to a face.
<#/GAPDoc>

<#GAPDoc Label="PolygonalComplex_Definition">
A <E>polygonal complex</E> is a two-dimensional incidence geometry consisting 
of vertices, edges and faces such that the following conditions hold (for a
more intuitive explanation see section 
<Ref Sect="PolygonalStructures_complex"/>):
<Enum>
    <Item><#Include Label="PolygonalComplex_Edge"></Item>
    <Item><#Include Label="PolygonalComplex_Face"></Item>
    <Item><#Include Label="PolygonalComplex_Incidence"></Item>
</Enum>
A <E>triangular complex</E> is a polygonal complex where every face has
exactly three incident vertices.
<#/GAPDoc>


<#GAPDoc Label="PolygonalComplex_Ramified">
Every edge is incident to at most two faces.
<#/GAPDoc>


<#GAPDoc Label="PolygonalComplex_Paths">
For every vertex <M>V</M> all incident edges and faces can
be arranged in an umbrella around <M>V</M> (compare
definition <Ref Subsect="Definition_Umbrella"/>).
<#/GAPDoc>

<#GAPDoc Label="Umbrella_Definition">
An <E>umbrella around the vertex <M>V</M></E> is a tuple
<M>(e_1,f_1,e_2,f_2, \ldots, e_n, f_n, e_{{n+1}})</M> such that:
<List>
    <Item>The <M>f_i</M> are pairwise disjoint faces incident to <M>V</M>.
        </Item>
    <Item>The <M>e_i</M> are pairwise disjoint edges incident to <M>V</M>
        (with the possible exception of <M>e_1 = e_{{n+1}}</M> in the case
        <M>n > 1</M>).</Item>
    <Item>The edges <M>e_i</M> and <M>e_{{i+1}}</M> are incident to <M>f_i</M>
        for all <M>i</M>.</Item>
</List>
If <M>e_1 = e_{{n+1}}</M> the umbrella is called <E>closed</E>.
