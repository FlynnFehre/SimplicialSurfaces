% WARNING: If you use this file, take care that it is always hidden away in a

% We use the following labelling convention:
%   If there are vertex labels they are turned on by vertexLabels
%   Edge labels are turned on by edgeLabels
%   Face labels are turned on by faceLabels
% If you want to turn on all labels, you define allLabels
    \ifdefined\allLabels
        \def\vertexLabels{1}
        \def\edgeLabels{1}
        \def\faceLabels{1}
    \fi

 

% Command to set the vertex labels (in the correct colour)
\def\vLabel#1#2{
    label={[\vertexColor]#1:\ifdefined\vertexLabels #2 \fi}
}
