Since we generate our pictures automatically, there are some restrictions on
the possible names (mainly for the convenience of the implementation):

1) The substring "-clean.tex" is forbidden (it is used by de-macro as a
    standard output format and is automatically removed after compilation)
2) The string prefic "_IMAGE_" is taken for automatically generated images.
    All other files that start this way and were not generated by the system
    will be removed by it. (This goes back to our mechanism of encoding the
    hash of the code in its name - if we don't want our directory to be
    flooded with old images whose original code has changed, we have to remove
    them.)
